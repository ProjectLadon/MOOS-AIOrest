  This method **shall** call the ```isUpdateOnly()``` method of the element of ```publishers``` that the ```publishPtr``` currently points to. If it is ```true```, this method **shall** check if the element ```isFresh()```. If this is false, this method **shall** iterate through the ```publishers``` vector, wrapping around once, until it either finds an element that passes these tests or reaches its starting point. If it reaches the starting point, this method **shall** return ```false```.
