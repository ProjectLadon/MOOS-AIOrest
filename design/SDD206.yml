  On any ```pubFile``` key, the software **shall** attempt to load the named file and parse it as JSON (exiting if parsing fails). If it successfully parses and contains a JSON array, it **shall** pass each element of that array to ```conf->addPublisher()```. If  it does not contain an array or any return ```false```, the software **shall** exit with an error.
