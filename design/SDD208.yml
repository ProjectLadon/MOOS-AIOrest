  On any ``confFile`` key, the software **shall** attempt to load the named file and parse it as JSON (exiting if parsing fails). If it successfully parses and contains a JSON array, each element **shall** be passed to ``conf->addPublisher()`` and ``conf->addSubscriber()`` in turn. If the file does not contain a JSON array or both of these calls return ``false`` for any element, the softare **shall** exit with an error.
